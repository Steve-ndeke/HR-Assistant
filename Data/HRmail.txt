Dear HR,

Hope you are doing fine.

Out of {0} application(s), I have processed {1} apllication(s) and rejected {2} application(s).
The rejected application(s) could be due to the following reasons;

    1. The apllicant did not use the provided resume template to update their resume.
    2. The aaplicant did not attach any resume in their application mail.

I have however notified the respective applicant(s) about their mistakes and urged them to reapply .

To those who followed the instructions have been notified accordingly.

PLEASE find attached Excel file containing the application Summary.

Regards,
